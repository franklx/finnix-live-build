# Adds a few extra default fields:
# - Zram (left, bar)
# - DiskIO (left, bar)
# - NetworkIO (right, text)
# - Battery (right, text)
#
# Note that htoprc is not externally-modified friendly, and
# pretty much any manual modification will cause the config to
# reset back to default. The current hook-files file is based
# on an htop 3.2.2 config; as of this version it does appear
# to support a subset against implicit defaults, so the file
# only contains changed fields. But this is not guaranteed,
# and should be periodically checked.
